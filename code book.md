Oops, this was previously submitted with my readme file..here is the code book:

Variables:
activityname - name of activity that was being performed by subject when data was collected
subject - ID corresponding to subject who data was collected from

The rest of the variables are averages of various measurements taken by an individual subject performing an activity:
